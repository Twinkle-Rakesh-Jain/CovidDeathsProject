    <h1>Project Title: COVID-19 Data Analysis</h1>

    <p><strong>Project Description:</strong></p>

    <p>In response to the global COVID-19 pandemic, a comprehensive analysis was conducted leveraging a dataset containing crucial information including location, date, total cases, new cases, total deaths, and population. Employing SQL Workbench, the dataset was meticulously processed and analyzed to derive actionable insights, paving the way for the creation of dynamic visualizations in Tableau.</p>

    <p>The project commenced with the loading of the COVID-19 dataset into SQL Workbench, where strategic SQL queries were meticulously crafted to extract pertinent insights vital for constructing informative Tableau visualizations. Four distinct datasheets were meticulously prepared to cater to various aspects of the COVID-19 data, ensuring comprehensive coverage and depth of analysis.</p>

    <h2>Tableau Datasheets:</h2>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Global Numbers Overview:</strong><br>
        This datasheet aggregates essential global statistics, including total cases, total deaths, and the percentage of deaths in relation to total cases. By condensing this information into a concise table, it provides an immediate snapshot of the pandemic's impact on a global scale.</li>

        <li><strong>Continent-wise Death Distribution:</strong><br>
        Focusing on continental disparities, this datasheet offers a detailed breakdown of total death counts across different continents. Presented in a horizontal bar chart format, it facilitates easy comparison and visualization of the pandemic's varying impacts across different regions.</li>

        <li><strong>Population Infection Analysis:</strong><br>
        Through this datasheet, a deeper understanding of infection rates in relation to population density is achieved. By correlating location, population, and infection metrics, it highlights countries with the highest infection rates relative to their population size. Visualized through a symbol map chart, it provides a spatial context to the pandemic's spread.</li>

        <li><strong>Temporal Infection Trends:</strong><br>
        Tracking the evolution of the pandemic over time, this datasheet showcases temporal trends in infection rates. By plotting percent population infected from 2021 to 2023, alongside a forecast, it offers insights into the trajectory of the pandemic, aiding in strategic planning and decision-making.</li>
    </ol>

    <p><strong>Tableau Dashboard:</strong></p>

    <p>Integrating these four datasheets, a comprehensive Tableau dashboard was crafted, synthesizing multifaceted insights into a cohesive visual narrative. The dashboard seamlessly presents:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Global Numbers</strong> in a compact table format.</li>
        <li><strong>Continent-wise Death Distribution</strong> through intuitive horizontal bar charts.</li>
        <li><strong>Population Infection Analysis</strong> with a dynamic symbol map chart.</li>
        <li><strong>Temporal Infection Trends</strong> illustrated via an insightful line chart with forecast projections.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Through this holistic approach, the Tableau dashboard serves as a powerful tool for stakeholders to grasp the magnitude and trajectory of the COVID-19 pandemic, enabling informed decision-making and strategic planning in combating the crisis.</p>
